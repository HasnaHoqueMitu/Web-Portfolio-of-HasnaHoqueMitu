            <p>I'm from Bangladesh. I've completed My BSc from North South University at January 2019. Then I was selected By BJET. BJET is a project of JICA which gives opportunity to Bangladeshi Engineers to work in Japan. In BJET I learned Japaneese Language N5 level. I started my career here at September 2019. I have worked with UIPath and gathered some knowledge on RPA. But now I want so switch. I want to be a web developer. And also searching for a work environment where people can speak in english.</p>
